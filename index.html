            <h2>Who is Tom Brady?</h2>
            <p><span class="bold"> Thomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr. (born August 3, 1977) is an American football
                    quarterback </span> for the Tampa
                Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL). He spent his first 20 seasons with the New England
                Patriots organization, with which he was a central contributor to the franchise's dynasty from 2001 to
                2019. Brady is widely regarded as the greatest quarterback of all time.

                After playing college football at Michigan, Brady was selected 199th overall by the Patriots in the
                sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft, later earning him a reputation as the NFL's biggest draft
                steal. He became the starting quarterback during his second season, which saw the Patriots win
                their first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXVI. As the team's primary starter for 18 seasons, Brady
                led the Patriots to 17 division titles (including 11 consecutive from 2009 to 2019), 13 AFC Championship
                Games (including eight consecutive from 2011 to 2018), nine Super Bowl appearances, and six Super Bowl
                titles, all NFL records for a player and franchise. He joined the Buccaneers in 2020 and led them to
                win Super Bowl LV, extending his individual records to ten Super Bowl appearances and seven
                victories.</p>


            <p>Brady holds nearly every major quarterback record, including passing yards, completions, touchdown
                passes, and games started. Never having a losing season, he is the NFL leader in career quarterback
                wins, quarterback regular season wins, quarterback playoff wins, and Super Bowl MVP awards, as well as
                being the only Super Bowl MVP for two different franchises. <span class="bold">Additional accolades held
                    by Brady include
                    the most Pro Bowl selections and the first unanimous NFL MVP </span>. The only quarterback to win a
                Super Bowl
                in three separate decades, Brady is also noted for the longevity of his success. He is the oldest NFL
                MVP at age 40, the oldest Super Bowl MVP at age 43, and the oldest quarterback selected to the Pro Bowl
                at age 44. Brady is the only NFL quarterback named to two all-decade teams (2000s and 2010s)
                and was unanimously named to the 100th Anniversary All-Time Team in 2019.</p>


            <p>Brady was a lightly regarded prospect coming out of college, with an unimpressive NFL Scouting
                Combine performance reinforcing this reputation. As a result, he was not selected until the sixth
                round of the 2000 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots, 199th overall, and was the seventh quarterback
                taken. Brady's success as a passer has been attributed to his work ethic, competitive spirit, pocket
                awareness, and intelligence.


                Brady during the 2009 preseason
                <span class="bold"> Brady has started 372 games (325 regular season, 47 playoff)[66] in 23 seasons, the
                    most for an NFL
                    quarterback </span>. His first 20 seasons were with the Patriots, which is also the most for an NFL
                quarterback
                with one franchise. He has served as the primary starter in 20 of his seasons, holding a backup role
                during his rookie campaign and missing nearly all the 2008 season due to a knee injury. The 2008
                season marks the only time that Brady has not started because of injury. Brady has never had a losing
                season as the starter and only missed the playoffs in 2002, the first year he started all 16 regular
                season games. With the Patriots, Brady led the team to 17 AFC East titles. He led the Tampa Bay
                Buccaneers in 2020 to a wild card berth, the only time his team did not make the playoffs as a division
                winner, and an NFC South title the following season.

                ways on so many different levels. I'm very fortunate that he's our quarterback and what he's able to do
                for this team. It's good to win with him and all the rest of our players. If that's more than somebody
                else did, I don't really care about that."
